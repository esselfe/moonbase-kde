cat << EOF
This project translates events from various input devices to keypresses on a keyboard and pointer events (mouse movement).

TV remotes Fully supported through libcec Not all TV remotes emit the same key events when buttons are being pressed, so
particular remotes might need to map their buttons in the config file.

Wiimotes partial, only Wiimote and Nunchuk buttons so far Only official Wiimotes and Wii Plus remotes are supported.
Devices connected through e.g. a DolphinBar are not supported yet KDE's screen management software.
