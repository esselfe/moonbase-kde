cat << EOF
GammaRay is a tool for examining and manipulating the internals of a Qt
application at runtime.
GammaRay augments conventional debuggers by understanding the implementation
of Qt, allowing it to visualize application behavior on a higher level,
especially with complex frameworks like scene graphs, model/view or state
machines being involved.
