cat << EOF
CalcMySky is a software package that simulates scattering of light by the atmosphere to render
daytime and twilight skies (without stars). Its primary purpose is to enable realistic view of
the sky in applications such as planetaria. Secondary objective is to make it possible to explore
atmospheric effects such as glories, fogbows etc., as well as simulate unusual environments such
as on Mars or an exoplanet orbiting a star with a non-solar spectrum of radiation.
