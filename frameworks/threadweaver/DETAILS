ThreadWeaver is a helper for multithreaded programming.  It uses a job-based
interface to queue tasks and execute them in an efficient way.

You simply divide the workload into jobs, state the dependencies between the jobs
and ThreadWeaver will work out the most efficient way of dividing the work between
threads within a set of resource limits.

See the information on [use cases](@ref usecases) and
[why multithreading can help](@ref multithreading), as well as the usage
section below, for more detailed information.
