With Kwave you can edit many sorts of wav-files including multi-channel files.
You are able to alter and play back each channel on its own.
Kwave also includes many plugins (most are still under development) to
transform the wave-file in several ways and presents a graphical view with a
complete zoom and scroll capability.
