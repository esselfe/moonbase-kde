cat << EOF
A collection of functions used by some games or which are useful for other
games.
Contents:
  kcarddialog: Access to carddeck selection and administration
               for cardgames
  kstdgameaction: just like kstdaction this provides some default action for
                  kde games. games often use different entries than other apps
                  (like "game" instead of "file"), so use this if possible
  kgamemisc: some static method i didn't know a good class name for. it
             currently features "randomName()" which will just give you a random name from
             a list (translators note: happy translating ;) i copied kde-common/accounts
             for this so there are nearly 300 entries...)
  kgame: this is a complete network/game handling library. it constists of a lot
         of classes which are explained in the kgame docu (as soon as it is
         written)
  kgamecanvas: a fast game-oriented canvas library
